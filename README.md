Unmasking the Private: Adversarial Attacks on Differential Privacy

WorkFlow
->1. Preprocessing<br>
One-hot encode or normalize both data sets (df_A and df_B)
->2. Triplet Embedding Training
Train to learn an embedding space such that similar rows are near each other
->3. Code Both Datasets
->4. Matching to FAISS
Get top-1 (or top-K) nearest neighbors for each row
Measure distances and indices
->5. Score and Filter
Transform distances into confidence: confidence = 1 / (1 + distance).
->7. Evaluate
